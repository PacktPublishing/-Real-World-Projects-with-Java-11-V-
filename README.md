## About the Video Course
Java is an easy language to learn, but a hard language to master. This course is specifically designed to teach you how to master a very common and very powerful programming language – Java while building multiple real-world applications from scratch.
The projects that we would be creating will use the many functionalities of Java.  After setting up the ideal development environment, you will build a text based game using Object Oriented Programming. In the next project, you will use JavaFX to build a media player UI from scratch. The final project will be a chat application where we will setup the database in the beginning and then make it communicate over the internet using Java by implementing your acquired knowledge in OOP in a robust custom network. 
Upon completing this course, you will have the necessary skills to build useful and powerful real-world Java projects on your own.
